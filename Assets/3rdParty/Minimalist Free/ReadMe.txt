If you are in Lightweight Render pipeline, you might see the materials rendering pink.
There is a Lightweight variant of the shader(MinimalistFree_V2/LightWeight/Standard). If you are in Lightweight render pipeline, please switch the shader to the lightweight variants in the materials.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the assets, please contact me.
