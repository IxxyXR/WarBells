# DefaultPlayables

(From https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/default-playables-95266 because for some reason Unity haven't uploaded this to a git repo)

This package includes both the Timeline Playables Wizard and a number of example Playables for you to use with Timeline. 

The Timeline Playables Wizard is a tool to help you write all the boiler plate code for your Playables for use with Timeline. In some cases it will write all of the code for you! 

The example Playables include:

* LightControl
* NavMeshControl
* ScreenFader
* TextSwitcher
* TimeDilation
* TransformTween
* Video

Documentation on how to use everything in the package is included as a pdf.
